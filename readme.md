## The fake report card

<img src="maxresdefault.jpg" width="400px" height="400px">

I failed the first quarter of a class in middle school, so I made a fake report card. I did this every quarter that year. I forgot that they mail home the end-of-year cards, and my mom got it before I could intercept with my fake. She was PISSED—at the school for their error. The teacher also retired that year and had already thrown out his records, so they had to take my mother’s “proof” (the fake ones I made throughout the year) and “correct” the “mistake.” I’ve never told her the truth.


Since then I never ever lied to my mother again,watching her fight for me  
even if it was all a big lie made me understand her Love for me.  
But with other people in general I try always to lie to reach my goals.

This experience profoundly impacted my relationship with my mother, teaching me the depth of her love and dedication. Despite this, the incident didn't completely deter my tendency to lie; instead, it reinforced my cunning nature. To this day, I navigate my interactions with others strategically, often bending the truth to achieve my objectives.

He asked his mother about her greying hair. Her mother thought it could be an opportunity to teach her child a lesson. So, she said that every bad action of his turns one of her hairs grey. He innocently replies that now he knows why his grandmother has only grey hairs on her head.

This habit of *lying* to others has become second nature to me, a tool I use without guilt. Each success built on a lie only reinforced my belief that honesty was unnecessary.

Yet, deep down, the guilt of deceiving ***my mother, my own flesh***, remains a heavy **burden**.
